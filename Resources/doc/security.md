# Security

To completely disable some operations from your application, refers to [Disabling operations](operations.md#disabling-operations).

This bundle relies on security features provided by the [Symfony Security Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html). For instance, if you wish to restrict the access of some endpoints, you can use [Access controls directives](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html#securing-url-patterns-access-control).

It is also possible to use the [Event system](the-event-system.md) for more advanced logic or even [Custom controlers](controllers.md#using-a-custom-controller) if you really need to.
