# Serialization groups and relations

## Using serialization groups

Symfony 2.7 introduced [serialization (and deserialization) groups support](http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-2-7-serialization-groups)
in the Serializer component. Specifying to the API system the groups to use is damn easy:

```yaml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    resource.product:
        parent:    "api.resource"
        arguments: [ "AppBundle\Entity\Product" ]
        calls:
            -      method:    "initNormalizationContext"
                   arguments: [ { groups: [ "serialization_group1", "serialization_group2" ] } ]
            -      method:    "initDenormalizationContext"
                   arguments: [ { groups: [ "deserialization_group1", "deserialization_group2" ] } ]
        tags:      [ { name: "api.resource" } ]
```

The built-in controller and the Hydra documentation generator will leverage specified serialization and deserialization
to give access only to exposed properties and to guess if they are readable or/and writable.

## Annotations

The Symfony serializer allows to specify the definition of serialization using XML, YAML, or annotations. As annotations are really easy to understand, we'll use them in following examples.  
However, in order to use annotations, don't forget to enable it in the serializer configuration:
```yaml
# app/config/config.yml
framework:
    # ...
    serializer:      { enable_annotations: true }
```

## Embedding relations

By default, the serializer provided with DunglasApiBundle will represent relations between objects by dereferenceables
URIs. They allow to retrieve details of related objects by issuing an extra HTTP request.

In the following JSON document, the relation from an offer to a product is represented by an URI:

```json
{
  "@context": "/contexts/Offer",
  "@id": "/offer/62",
  "@type": "Offer",
  "price": 31.2,
  "product": "/products/59"
}
```

## Embedding the context

By default, the context attribute (`@context`) will be serialized as an URI:
```json
{
  "@context": "/contexts/Offer"
}
```

You can also decide to embed it:
```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://localhost/vocab#",
    "hydra": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
    "name": "#Offer/name"
  }
}
```

For this, register the following services (for example in `app/config/services.yml`):

```yaml
services:
    # ...

    resource.offer:
        parent:    "api.resource"
        arguments: [ "AppBundle\Entity\Offer" ]
        calls:
            -      method:    "initNormalizationContext"
                   arguments: [ { jsonld_context_embedded: true } ]
        tags:      [ { name: "api.resource" } ]
```

### Normalization

From a performance point of view, it's sometimes necessary to avoid extra HTTP requests. It is possible to embed related
objects (or only some of their properties) directly in the parent response trough serialization groups.
By using the following serizalization groups annotations (`@Groups`) and this updated service definition, a JSON representation
of the product is embedded in the offer response:

```php
<?php

// src/AppBundle/Entity/Offer.php

namespace AppBundle\Entity;

use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Annotation\Groups;

class Offer
{
    // ...
    
    /**
     * ...
     * @Groups({"offer"})
     */
    public $price;
    
    /**
     * ...
     * @Groups({"offer"})
     */
    public $product;
}
```

```php
<?php

// src/AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

namespace AppBundle\Entity;

use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Annotation\Groups;

class Product
{
    // ...

    /**
     * ...
     * @Groups({"offer"})
     */
    public $name;
}
```

Register the following services (for example in `app/config/services.yml`):

```yaml
services:
    # ...

    resource.offer:
        parent:    "api.resource"
        arguments: [ "AppBundle\Entity\Offer" ]
        calls:
            -      method:    "initNormalizationContext"
                   arguments: [ { groups: [ "offer" ] } ]
        tags:      [ { name: "api.resource" } ]
```

The generated JSON with previous settings will be like the following:

```json
{
  "@context": "/contexts/Offer",
  "@id": "/offer/62",
  "@type": "Offer",
  "price": 31.2,
  "product": {
    "@id": "/products/59",
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "Lyle and Scott polo skirt"
  }
}
```

### Denormalization

It is also possible to embed a relation in `PUT` and `POST` requests. To enable that feature, serialization groups must be
set the same way as normalization and the service definition must be like the following:

```yaml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    # ...

    resource.offer:
        parent:     "api.resource"
        arguments:  [ "AppBundle\Entity\Offer" ]
        calls:
            -       method:    "initDenormalizationContext"
                    arguments:
                        -      { groups: [ "offer" ] }
        tags:       [ { name: "api.resource" } ]
```

The following rules apply when denormalizating embedded relations:
* if a `@id` key is present in the embedded resource, the object corresponding to the given URI will be retrieved trough
the data provider and any changes in the embedded relation will be applied to that object.
* if no `@id` key exists, a new object will be created containing data provided in the embedded JSON document.

You can create as relation embedding levels as you want.

### Name conversion

The Serializer Component provides a handy way to translate or map PHP field names to serialized names. See the
[Symfony documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/master/components/serializer.html#converting-property-names-when-serializing-and-deserializing)

To use this feature, declare a new service with id `api.name_converter`. For example, you can convert `CamelCase` to 
`snake_case` with the following configuration:

```yaml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    # ...

    api.name_converter:
        class: Symfony\Component\Serializer\NameConverter\CamelCaseToSnakeCaseNameConverter
```

### Entity identifier case

Actually we identify the entity identifier from [Doctrine Identifier](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/basic-mapping.html#identifiers-primary-keys).
We don't support entity resource with multiple identifier.

The entity identifier is never returned like other properties : it's a part of the URI contained in `@id` field. 
So in the `/vocab` endpoint : identifier not appear in the properties list.

#### Entity identifier writable

In some case, you will be able to set from the client the identifier of a resource. (like a slug for example)
So, in this case the identifier property must become a writable class property in the /vocab endpoint.

To do this you simply have to : 
* create a a setter for identifier in the entity
* add the denormalization group to the property if you use a specific denormalization group
