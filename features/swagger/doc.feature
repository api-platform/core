Feature: Documentation support
  In order to build an auto-discoverable API
  As a client software developer
  I need to know Swagger specifications of objects I send and receive

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Retrieve the Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
    Given I send a "GET" request to "/doc.json"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    # Context
    And the JSON node "swagger" should be equal to "2.0"
    # Root properties
    And the JSON node "info.title" should be equal to "My Dummy API"
    And the JSON node "info.description" should be equal to "This is a test API."
    # Supported classes

    # Filters
    And the JSON node "paths./dummies.get.parameters[0].name" should be equal to "id"

  Scenario: Swagger UI is enabled for the doc endpoint
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "text/html"
    And I send a "GET" request to "/doc"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should see text matching "My Dummy API"

  @dropSchema
  Scenario: Swagger UI is enabled for an arbitrary endpoint
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "text/html"
    And I send a "GET" request to "/dummies"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should see text matching "My Dummy API"
