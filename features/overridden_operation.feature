Feature: Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete with a Overridden Operation context
  In order to use an hypermedia API
  As a client software developer
  I need to be able to retrieve, create, update and delete JSON-LD encoded resources.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a resource
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies" with body:
    """
    {
      "name": "My Overridden Operation Dummy",
      "description" : "Gerard",
      "alias": "notWritable"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    {
      "@context": "/contexts/OverriddenOperationDummy",
      "@id": "/overridden_operation_dummies/1",

      "name": "My Overridden Operation Dummy",
      "alias": null,
      "description": "Gerard"
    }
    """

  Scenario: Get a resource
    When I send a "GET" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies/1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:

  Scenario: Get a resource in XML
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/xml"
    And I send a "GET" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies/1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/xml; charset=utf-8"

    When I send a "GET" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies/42"
    Then the response status code should be 404

    When I send a "GET" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies"

  Scenario: Update a resource
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "PUT" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies/1" with body:

  Scenario: Get the final resource
    When I send a "GET" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies/1"

  Scenario: Delete a resource
    When I send a "DELETE" request to "/overridden_operation_dummies/1"
    Then the response status code should be 204
    And the response should be empty
