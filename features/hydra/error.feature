Feature: Error handling
  In order to be able to handle error client side
  As a client software developer
  I need to retrieve an Hydra serialization of errors
  That is compatible with the JSON Problem specification

  Scenario: Get an rfc 7807 error
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/exception_problems" with body:
    """
    {}
    """
    Then the response status code should be 400
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/problem+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the header "Link" should contain '<http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/error>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#error"'
    And the JSON node "type" should exist
    And the JSON node "title" should be equal to "An error occurred"
    And the JSON node "hydra:title" should be equal to "An error occurred"
    And the JSON node "detail" should exist
    And the JSON node "hydra:description" should exist
    And the JSON node "trace" should exist
    And the JSON node "status" should exist
    And the JSON node "@context" should not exist

  Scenario: Get validation constraint violations
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/dummy_problems" with body:
    """
    {}
    """
    Then the response status code should be 422
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/problem+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    {
          "@id": "/validation_errors/c1051bb4-d103-4f74-8988-acbcafc7fdc3",
