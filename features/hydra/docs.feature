Feature: Documentation support
  In order to build an auto-discoverable API
  As a client software developer
  I need to know Hydra specifications of objects I send and receive

  Scenario: Checks that the Link pointing to the Hydra documentation is set
    Given I send a "GET" request to "/"
    Then the header "Link" should be equal to '<http://example.com/docs.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#apiDocumentation"'

  Scenario: Retrieve the API vocabulary
    Given I send a "GET" request to "/docs.jsonld"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
