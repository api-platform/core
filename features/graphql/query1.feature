Feature: GraphQL query support

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Execute an empty GraphQL query
    When I send a "GET" request to "/graphql"
    Then the response status code should be 400
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json"
    And the JSON node "errors[0].message" should be equal to "GraphQL query is not valid"

  Scenario: Introspect the GraphQL schema
    When I send the following GraphQL request:
    """
    {
      __schema {
        types {
          name
        }
      }
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json"
    And the JSON node "data.__schema.types" should exist

  Scenario: Introspect types
    When I send the following GraphQL request:
    """
