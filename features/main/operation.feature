Feature: Operation support
  In order to make the API fitting custom need
  As an API developer
  I need to be able to add custom operations and remove built-in ones

  @createSchema
  @dropSchema
  Scenario: Can not write readonly property
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/readable_only_properties" with body:
    """
    {
      "name": "My Dummy"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    {
      "@context": "/contexts/ReadableOnlyProperty",
      "@id": "/readable_only_properties/1",
      "@type": "ReadableOnlyProperty",
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Read only"
    }
    """

  Scenario: Access custom operations
    When I send a "GET" request to "/relation_embedders/42/custom"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    "This is a custom action for 42."
    """

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Select a resource and it's embedded data
    Given there are 1 embedded dummy objects
    When I send a "GET" request to "/embedded_dummies_groups/1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    {
        "@context": "/contexts/EmbeddedDummy",
        "@id": "/embedded_dummies/1",
        "@type": "EmbeddedDummy",
        "name": "Dummy #1",
        "embeddedDummy": {
            "dummyName": "Dummy #1"
        }
    }
    """
