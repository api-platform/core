/**
 * UrlGeneratorInterface is the interface that all URL generator classes must implement.
 *
 * This interface has been imported and adapted from the Symfony project.
 *
 * The constants in this interface define the different types of resource references that
 * are declared in RFC 3986: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
 * We are using the term "URL" instead of "URI" as this is more common in web applications
 * and we do not need to distinguish them as the difference is mostly semantical and
 * less technical. Generating URIs, i.e. representation-independent resource identifiers,
 * is also possible.

     * When the passed reference type cannot be generated for the route because it requires a different
     * host or scheme than the current one, the method will return a more comprehensive reference

     * ABSOLUTE_URL with the https scheme and the current host. This makes sure the generated URL matches
     * the route in any case.

     * If there is no route with the given name, the generator must throw the RouteNotFoundException.
