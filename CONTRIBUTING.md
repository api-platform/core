# Contributing to API Platform

First of all, thank you for contributing, you're awesome!

To have your code integrated in the API Platform project, there are some rules to follow, but don't panic, it's easy!

## Reporting Bugs

If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it. However, before submitting it, please:

* Check the [project documentation available online](https://api-platform.com/docs/)

Then, if it appears that it's a real bug, you may report it using GitHub by following these 3 points:

* Check if the bug is not already reported!
* A clear title to resume the issue
* A description of the workflow needed to reproduce the bug

> _NOTE:_ Don't hesitate giving as much information as you can (OS, PHP version extensions...)

## Pull Requests

### Writing a Pull Request

First of all, you must decide on what branch your changes will be based depending of the nature of the change.
See [the dedicated documentation entry](https://api-platform.com/docs/extra/releases/).

To prepare your patch directly in the `vendor/` of an existing project (convenient to fix a bug):

1. Remove the existing copy of the library: `rm -Rf vendor/api-platform/core`
2. Reinstall the lib while keeping Git metadata: `composer install --prefer-source`
3. You can now work directly in `vendor/api-platform/core`, create a new branch: `git checkout -b my_patch`
4. When your patch is ready, fork the project and add your Git remote: `git remote add <your-name> git@github.com:<your-name>/core.git`
5. You can now push your code and open your Pull Request: `git push <your-name> my_patch`

Alternatively, you can also work with the test application we provide:

    cd tests/Fixtures/app
    ./console assets:install --symlink
    symfony serve
    
    # or if you prefer using the PHP built-in web server
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public/

### Matching Coding Standards

The API Platform project follows [Symfony coding standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using the [PHP CS Fixer](https://cs.sensiolabs.org/) tool:

    php-cs-fixer.phar fix

And then, add the fixed file to your commit before pushing.
Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If any other file is fixed by cs tools, just revert it before committing.

### Backward Compatibility Promise

API Platform is following the [Symfony Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).

When you are making a change, make sure no BC break is added.

### Deprecating Code

Adding a deprecation is sometimes necessary in order to follow the backward compatibility promise and to improve an existing implementation.

They can only be introduced in minor or major versions (`main` branch) and exceptionally in patch versions if they are critical.

See also the [related documentation for Symfony](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/conventions.html#deprecating-code).

### Sending a Pull Request

When you send a PR, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases (Behat and PHPUnit).
* Tests are green.
* You make a PR on the related documentation in the [api-platform/docs](https://github.com/api-platform/docs) repository.
* You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commits
that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
* Also don't forget to add a comment when you update a PR with a ping to [the maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/api-platform/people), so he/she will get a notification.

The commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
The following types are allowed:

* `fix`: bug fix
* `feat`: new feature
* `docs`: change in the documentation
* `spec`: spec change
* `test`: test-related change
* `perf`: performance optimization
* `ci`: CI-related change
* `chore`: updating dependencies and related changes

Examples:

    fix(metadata): resource identifiers from properties 

    feat(validation): introduce a number constraint

    feat(metadata)!: new resource metadata system, BC break

    docs(doctrine): search filter on uuids

    test(doctrine): mongodb disambiguation

We strongly recommend the use of a scope on API Platform core.

### Tests

On `api-platform/core` there are two kinds of tests: unit (`phpunit` through `simple-phpunit`) and integration tests (`behat`).

Both `simple-phpunit` and `behat` are development dependencies and should be available in the `vendor` directory.

#### PHPUnit and Coverage Generation

To launch unit tests:

    vendor/bin/simple-phpunit --stop-on-failure -vvv

If you want coverage, you will need the `pcov` PHP extension and run:

    vendor/bin/simple-phpunit --coverage-html coverage -vvv --stop-on-failure

Sometimes there might be an error with too many open files when generating coverage. To fix this, you can increase the `ulimit`, for example:

    ulimit -n 4000

Coverage will be available in `coverage/index.html`.

#### Behat

The command to launch Behat tests is:

    php -d memory_limit=-1 ./vendor/bin/behat --profile=default --stop-on-failure --format=progress

If you want to launch Behat tests for MongoDB, the command is:

    MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017 APP_ENV=mongodb php -d memory_limit=-1 ./vendor/bin/behat --profile=mongodb --stop-on-failure --format=progress

To get more details about an error, replace `--format=progress` by `-vvv`. You may run a mongo instance using docker:

	docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest

# Releases

This section is for maintainers.

1. Update the JavaScript dependencies by running `./update-js.sh` (always check if it works in a browser)
2. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file (be sure to include Pull Request numbers when appropriate)
3. Create a signed tag: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"`
4. Create a release using GitHub's UI and copy the changelog 
5. Create a new release of `api-platform/api-platform`
