# Contributing to API Platform

First of all, thank you for contributing, you're awesome!

To have your code integrated in the API Platform project, there is some rules to follow, but don't panic, it's easy!

## Reporting bugs

If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it. However, before submitting it, please:

* Check the [project documentation available online](https://api-platform.com/doc/)

Then, if it appears that it's a real bug, you may report it using Github by following these 3 points:

* Check if the bug is not already reported!
* A clear title to resume the issue
* A description of the workflow needed to reproduce the bug

> _NOTE:_ Don’t hesitate giving as much information as you can (OS, PHP version extensions...)

## Pull requests

### Writing a Pull Request

First of all, you must decide on what branch your changes will be based. If the changes your are going to make are
fully backward-compatible, you should base your changes on the latest stable branch (`1.0` at the moment).
Otherwise, you should base your changes on the `master` branch.

### Matching coding standards

The API Platform project follows [Symfony coding standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).
But don't worry, you can fix CS issues automatically using the [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) tool

```bash
php-cs-fixer.phar fix
```

And then, add fixed file to your commit before push.
Be sure to add only **your modified files**. If another files are fixed by cs tools, just revert it before commit.

### Sending a Pull Request

When you send a PR, just make sure that:

* You add valid test cases (Behat and PHPUnit).
* Tests are green.
* You make a PR on the related documentation in the [api-platform/doc](https://github.com/api-platform/doc) repository.
* You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commits
that you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
* Also don't forget to add a comment when you update a PR with a ping to the maintainer (`@dunglas`, `@sroze` or `@theofidry`), so he/she will get a notification.
* Squash your commits into one commit. (see the next chapter)

All Pull Requests must include [this header](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Squash your commits

If you have 3 commits. So start with:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

An editor will be opened with your 3 commits, all prefixed by `pick`.

Replace all `pick` prefixes by `fixup` (or `f`) **except the first commit** of the list.

Save and quit the editor.

After that, all your commits where squashed into the first one and the commit message of the first commit.

If you would like to rename your commit message type:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

Now force push to update your PR:

```bash
git push --force
```
